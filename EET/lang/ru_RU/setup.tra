@910003 = ~Saves in EET behave exactly the same as in vanilla games which means you won't encounter any save problems when it comes to BG:EE, SoD and BG2:EE vanilla content, regardless of language chosen during installation and mod selection. If you didn't use other mods that add text to game than there is no need to update saves between different installations at all. Like in vanilla games this functionality is not extended to mod content (mods not related to EET don't use persistent TLK entries), which means additional save patching may be needed. Would you like to update your old saves made on previous installation to work with this new installation before installing the finalise component? Please keep in mind that it won't be possible to uninstall these changes. This step is also quite lengthy (may take several minutes depending on how many saves are located in %SAVE_DIRECTORY%).

 1] Yes, update saves
 2] No, continue without updating~
